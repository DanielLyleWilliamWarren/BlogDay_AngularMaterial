## Utilising the Angular Material Library to provide bespoke design solutions

The [Angular Material Library](https://material.angular.io/) is a collection of Material Design components which integrates with [Angular](https://angular.io/), a typescript based, open-source web development framework. The UI elements that the library provides are:

- Versatile: the same elements can be used on a desktop or mobile browser.
- Modifiable: elements can be adapted to fit with unique design requirements.
- Styleable: styles can be created and applied to all elements in a project, allowing for colour schemes to be lifted from a UX/UI Designer's prototype and applied to development.

Angular has become the a go-to development framework within BGS Digital for application development (myHaz-VTC , Sigma Lite), web development (EPOS, LIMS, myHaz-VTC Manager, SEAS Portal) and more recently PWA (progressive-web-app) in the form of BGS Explorer.
