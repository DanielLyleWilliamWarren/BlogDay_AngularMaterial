## Utilising the Angular Material Library to provide bespoke design solutions

The [Angular Material Library](https://material.angular.io/) is a collection of Material Design components which integrates with [Angular](https://angular.io/), a typescript based, open-source web development framework. The UI elements that the library provides are:
 - Versatile: the same elements can be used on a desktop or mobile browser.
 - Modifiable: elements can be adapted to suit unique design requirements.
 -  Styleable: styles can be created and applied to all elements in a project, allowing for colour schemes to be lifted from a UX/UI Designer's prototype and applied to development.

Angular has become the go-to development framework within BGS Digital for application development, web development and PWA (progressive web app) development. 
The Angular Material Library has allowed developers to work on multiple projects while utilising the same reusable UI components across multiple codebases, where project styles are applied.
